      APIs.  If <tt>http_headers</tt> does not contain a <tt>Content-Type</tt>
      header, then <tt>application/json</tt> is assumed.

      @param api_url A URL of a REST endpoint in which to make an HTTP call.
      @param http_headers HTTP headers to pass as part of the HTTP request.  By
                          default only <tt>Content-Type: application/json</tt>
                          HTTP header will be set.
      @param http_method The HTTP method or action to request from the server.
                         Currently supported methods include: GET, POST, PUT,
                         DELETE, and PATCH.

      @return If <tt>Content-Type</tt> HTTP header is
              <tt>application/json</tt>, then one of two types will be
              returned: <tt>HashMap</tt> or <tt>ArrayList</tt> (for JSON Object
              and JSON Array respectively).  If any other <tt>Content-Type</tt>
              HTTP header used then a <tt>String</tt> will be returned and it
              will be left up to the caller to parse the result.
